# CPP Module 02 - Fixed Point Numbers

## Overview
This module focuses on implementing a **Fixed** class to handle fixed-point arithmetic in C++.

## Key Topics
- **Fixed-Point Representation**: Using integers to store decimal values.
- **Bitwise Operations**: Shifting bits for precision adjustments.
- **Operator Overloading**: Implementing arithmetic and comparison operators.
- **Canonical Class Form**: Proper implementation of constructors, destructors, and assignment operators.

## Notes
- Ensure correct conversion between fixed and floating-point numbers.
